# Introduction
So, who am I? As stated on the left sidebar, I'm just an iDOLM@STER enjoyer :P More about myself, I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. I mostly focus on Front-end Web Developing, Game Developing and Designing, though I sometimes want to do a little bit of CTF.

# What is this blog for?
The purpose of this site is to archive my osu!gaming CTF 2024 write-ups, but I guess I'll try to shitpost and do some silly stuffs here.

# My silly stuffs you may ask?
Let me introduce you to some of my silly projects:
- [**JoSu!**](https://preview.tryz.id.vn) - An osu! beatmap viewer directly on the web
- [**TryZCustomOverlayLazer**](https://github.com/FukutoTojido/TryZCustomOverlayLazer) - A gosumemory overlay that mimics an early design of osu!lazer gameplay UI
- [**node-osuScoreConverter**](https://github.com/FukutoTojido/node-osuScoreConverter) - A CLI tool that convert your osu! scores from ScoreV1 to ScoreV2 and vice versa

I also do gosumemory overlay commission for [**Resurrection Cup**](https://rescup.xyz/) and [**Aim Cup**](https://twitter.com/aim_cup)

# What's next?
Well, that's pretty much everything I want to write in this post. I hope you can find something interesting to read here :D
